{

     varaible 
     
     Function
     
};

Object - Object is a run time entity of class until we defined object of class memory is not allocated to the class varialbe and functions

##### _**Contructor := **_

<details><summary> Contructor </summary>
<p>


Contructor is a special member function having same name as class name.
Contructor get automatically called when object is created. 
There is no return type to the contructor function.

When contructor is called memory get allocate to variables and functions of class.

There are three type of contructor:

1. Default contructor 

Example - `Example of contructor of default contructor : =`
https://github.com/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/fb8e1179b508b2e48d5e03ec0055bbe0b9efaa17/Basic_programs/constructor.cpp

Example 1 - `Write a program to create the class product which accept the rate of 4 different product and qunatity of product, define a default contructor which defines the rate for 4 different product and also define the quantity function which accept the quantities for each product. Display the bill on the basis of rate and quantity using bill function.
 : =`

Protected member are accesseble within that class and the child class which is derived from that perticular class.

When Base class is privately inherited by derived class, public member of base class become private members of derived class.

The public member of base class can only be accessed by member function of derived class.

They are inaccessible to the object of derived class.

On other hand when the base class is publicly inherited by derived class, public member of base also become a public member of derived class.

The public member of base class are accissible by the object of a derived class as well as by the member function of derived class.

There are 5 types of Inheritance -

1. Single inheritance.
     
2. multi level inheritance.
     
     Example 1 - `Example of multi level Inhertance : =`

3. Multiple inheritance- Two base class gives on child class

##### _**Polymorphisom := **_

<details><summary> Polymorphisom  :=  </summary>
<p>

It is a ability to take more than 1 form.
In it single functino or operator can be use for many purpose.
Their are two types of polymorphism
1. Static Polymorphism ( Compile time )
2. Dynamic Polymorphism ( Runtime )

##### Function overloading in cPP

Function overloading is a feature of c++ programming where two or more function can have same name but different parameter list.
This is a example of Compile time Polymorphism as given in below program.
ADD is function which is overload 
in first add function only one parameter is passed.
in second add functon two parameters are passed.
when we called add function compiler compares number of arguments passed to the function and called that particular function.

Example 1 - `Example of Function overloading : =`
https://github.com/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/333b31648e948a75380793c5ef36f03ece821571/Basic_programs/Basic1_Programs/function_overloading.cpp

Example 1 - `Write a c++ program to overload the max function which accept two and three arguments : =`
     
##### Operator Overloading in CPP
     
     Operator overloading is the concept which is use to give a spacial meaning to function which are provide by c++ programming languauge.
     
     It means that we can use a built in operator to perform action on a different types of data items 
     
     for example + sign is mostly used to perform arithmatic operation but if we use + sign with two string varaiables then it go into perform the operation addition on string which we called as concatation meand real meaning of the operator does not change but only type of varaible is change.
     
     in Operator overloading we give the special meaning to the operator.
     
     There are certain operator that cannot be overlaod 
1. Scope resolution operator ::
     
2. Size of operator 
     
3. Condition operator( ternary operator - ?;:
     
4. Dot operator .
     
5. Pointer operator *
     
Rules for Operator Overloading 
     1. existing operator can be overload.
     2.the overlaoded operator contain atleast one operand of user defined data type 
     3. we cannot use friend function to overlaod certain operators. However member function can to use to overlaod the operator 
     4. When unray operator are overloaded to member function takes no explicit argument but if they are overloaded by friend function takes one argument 
     5. When binary operator are overlaoded to a member function it takes one explicit argument and if they overlaoded through the friend function it takes two explicit argument.
     
Syntax of operator overlaoding 
     
     return_type operator op(argument_list)
     
Where return_type is a type of value return by the function
operator is a keyword.
op is a operator.

##### _**Pointers := **_

<details><summary> Pointers </summary>
<p>
     
Pointer is a variable which stores address of another varaiable.
     
Syntax:
Data_type *pointer_name=&varialbe

Example 1 - `Example of Pointer : =`
     https://github.dev/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/main/Basic_programs/Basic1_Programs/Array1.cpp

##### _**This Pointer  := **_


<details><summary> This Pointer </summary>
<p>

It is used to pass current object as parameter to another method.
It can be use to reffer current class instant variable

##### _** Exception Handling := **_

<details><summary> Exception Handling </summary>
<p>
An exception is a situation where program produce unexcepted error during the exception of the program. It is important to have a mechanism to deal with this situation or this exception.
Exception handling is a technique that seperate error handling code from main code of the program.
Exception can occur bcoz of following condition.
1]An attempt to divide by 0.
2]Accessing the array outside of bounds.
3]Running out of memory.
4]Running out of disk.

Try Block:-
Try - It is block of program code where exception is detected as soon as exception is detected try transfer the program control to the catch block by throwing the exception

Catch Block:-
Catch - It determines the type of exception and provide a block of code which will execute when exception is thrown, there can be multiple catch block in program depending upon type of exception arise. Catch is responsible for taking currective action for exception.

Throw Block:-
Throw - It is use to throw exception when problem occur and can be called from anywhere in the program. The point where throw is executed is refered as to throw point.
