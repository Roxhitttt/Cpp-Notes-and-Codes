When contructor is called memory get allocate to variables and functions of class.

There are three type of contructor:

1. Default contructor 

Example - `Example of contructor of default contructor : =`

Protected member are accesseble within that class and the child class which is derived from that perticular class.

When Base class is privately inherited by derived class, public member of base class become private members of derived class.

The public member of base class can only be accessed by member function of derived class.

They are inaccessible to the object of derived class.

On other hand when the base class is publicly inherited by derived class, public member of base also become a public member of derived class.

The public member of base class are accissible by the object of a derived class as well as by the member function of derived class.

There are 5 types of Inheritance -

1. Single inheritance.
     
2. multi level inheritance.
     
     Example 1 - `Example of multi level Inhertance : =`

##### _**Polymorphisom := **_

<details><summary> Polymorphisom  :=  </summary>
<p>

It is a ability to take more than 1 form.
In it single functino or operator can be use for many purpose.
Their are two types of polymorphism
1. Static Polymorphism ( Compile time )
2. Dynamic Polymorphism ( Runtime )

##### Function overloading in cPP

Function overloading is a feature of c++ programming where two or more function can have same name but different parameter list.
This is a example of Compile time Polymorphism as given in below program.
ADD is function which is overload 
in first add function only one parameter is passed.
in second add functon two parameters are passed.
when we called add function compiler compares number of arguments passed to the function and called that particular function.

Example 1 - `Example of Function overloading : =`
https://github.com/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/333b31648e948a75380793c5ef36f03ece821571/Basic_programs/Basic1_Programs/function_overloading.cpp

Example 1 - `Write a c++ program to overload the max function which accept two and three arguments : =`
     
##### Operator Overloading in CPP
     
     Operator overloading is the concept which is use to give a spacial meaning to function which are provide by c++ programming languauge.
     
     It means that we can use a built in operator to perform action on a different types of data items 
     
     for example + sign is mostly used to perform arithmatic operation but if we use + sign with two string varaiables then it go into perform the operation addition on string which we called as concatation meand real meaning of the operator does not change but only type of varaible is change.
     
     in Operator overloading we give the special meaning to the operator.
     
     There are certain operator that cannot be overlaod 
1. Scope resolution operator ::
     
2. Size of operator 
     
3. Condition operator( ternary operator - ?;:
     
4. Dot operator .
     
5. Pointer operator *
     
Rules for Operator Overloading 
     1. existing operator can be overload.
     2.the overlaoded operator contain atleast one operand of user defined data type 
     3. we cannot use friend function to overlaod certain operators. However member function can to use to overlaod the operator 
     4. When unray operator are overloaded to member function takes no explicit argument but if they are overloaded by friend function takes one argument 
     5. When binary operator are overlaoded to a member function it takes one explicit argument and if they overlaoded through the friend function it takes two explicit argument.
     
Syntax of operator overlaoding 
     
     return_type operator op(argument_list)
     
Where return_type is a type of value return by the function
operator is a keyword.
op is a operator.

##### _** Exception Handling := **_

<details><summary> Exception Handling </summary>
<p>
An exception is a situation where program produce unexcepted error during the exception of the program. It is important to have a mechanism to deal with this situation or this exception.
Exception handling is a technique that seperate error handling code from main code of the program.
Exception can occur bcoz of following condition.
1]An attempt to divide by 0.
2]Accessing the array outside of bounds.
3]Running out of memory.
4]Running out of disk.

Try Block:-
Try - It is block of program code where exception is detected as soon as exception is detected try transfer the program control to the catch block by throwing the exception

Catch Block:-
Catch - It determines the type of exception and provide a block of code which will execute when exception is thrown, there can be multiple catch block in program depending upon type of exception arise. Catch is responsible for taking currective action for exception.

Throw Block:-
Throw - It is use to throw exception when problem occur and can be called from anywhere in the program. The point where throw is executed is refered as to throw point.

Example 1 - `Example of Exception dividing by zero : =`
https://github.dev/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/main/Basic_programs/Basic1_Programs/Exception_devide_zero.cpp#L15

##### _**File Handling  := **_

<details><summary> File Handling </summary>
<p>
#include<fstream> - This is use for File Handling
	
	int main()
	
	{
	
    char info[30];
	
    char age[5];
	
    char add[30];
	
    ofstream of;
	
    of.open("demo.txt");
	
    cout<<"Now we are going to write into file"<<endl;
	
    cout<<"Enter your name";
	
    cin.getline(info,30);
	
    of<<info<<endl;
	
	of.close();

    return 0;

	}

Here ofstream is an Class which is used to create or open the existing file to write the content in the text file.
of is the object of the class.
of.open("demo.text") is used to open the created or existing file to write the txt inside text file.
cin.getline(info,30) is used to get the info variable from the console write the text.
of<<info<<endl; is used to transfer the written content from the console to the text file.
of.close(); is used to close the file.

	
Example 1 - `Example of File Handling to write a code into the file: =`
https://github.dev/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/main/Basic_programs/Basic1_Programs/file_hand_write.cpp#L14

Example 2 - `Example of File Handling to read a code into the file: =`
https://github.dev/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/main/Basic_programs/Basic1_Programs/file_hand_read.cpp#L13

Opening the file in CLeft shift is used to write.
Right shift is used to read.
To read data from file or to write data into file we need to open it first, This can be performed with the help of |ifstream| for reading & |ofstream| for writing. 
|fstream| for appending, all these three object have open() function pre-built in them.
	
Left shift is used to write.
Right shift is used to read.

The syntax of open() function given below:

	open(file_name,mode);
	
File name is a valid name of the file which we have to open.

Mode- There are three different mode to open a file.

	mode		description
	
	iso::in		File is open in read mode
	iso::out	File is open in write mode
	iso::app	File is open in append mode
	iso::ate	File is open in append mode but read and write perform at the end of the file.
	iso::binary	File is open in binary mode
	iso::trunc	File is open in truncate mode
	iso::nocreate	File is open only if it exist
	iso::noreplace	File is open only if it does not exist

https://github.dev/Roxhitttt/Cpp-Notes-and-Codes/blob/main/Basic_programs/Basic1_Programs/file_hand_mul3.cpp#L21

### Positioning File Pointer 
When you open a file in more than one mode using fstream class, it is not necessary to close the file and open it agaain. when you need to switch from one mode to another mode, but if you are writing and reading in different position of the file then the stream pointer have to be position appropriately, each file object has associated with 2 inter value called the gate pointer and the put pointer, these are also called as current gate position and the current put position or simple the current position, these values specify in the bit number in the file where reading or writing take place.

Function to move file pointer:
1. seekg() - for get a pointer
2. seekp() - for put pointer 

These function takes 2 argument - first argument is realative offset, that is the number of bytes the file pointer has to be moved
second argument is the position of file pointer from where offset is to be consider

seekg(5,ios::end);
seekp(5,ios::cur);

tellg(),tellp() - these function return the current position of get and put pointer in byte.

Inline Function
If we declare function using inline keyward then that function is called as Inline Function.
IF the function is inline Then Compiler replace the function calling location with the defination of the inline function at a time of compilation.

Syntax of Inline Funtion is given below:

inline return_type function_name(parameters)

{

Statements

}

The main use of inline function is to save memory space.

We cannot use Inline function in following situation: 
1. If the function is recurive then it is not used.
2. If a function contain loop-for loop then it is not used.
3. If contain Static variable then it is not used.
4. If function contain switch statement then it is not used.

Inline function can be used in following siuation:
1.When the function's performance is required.( operation required).
2.It can be used over the micros.
3.we can use inline function outside the class so that we can hide internal implementation of the function.

Advantage:
1.In the inline function, we do not need to call the function so it does not cause any overhead.
2.It can also save overhead of return statement from function.
3.It does not required any stack on which we can push or pop the variables as it does not perform any function calling.
4.Inline function is beneficial for embeded system as it yields less code than normal function.

Disadvantage:
1.The Variables that are created inside inline function will consume additional reigesters, if the variables increased then use of reigesters also increases which may incease the overhead on register variable resource utilization.
2.If we use many inline function then binary executable file also become large.
3.use of inline function can reduce the intruction cache hit rate,reduces the speed of intruction, fetch from the cache memory to that of primary memory.

Example 4 - `Example of inline function  : =`
